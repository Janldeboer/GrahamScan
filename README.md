# GrahamScan
This is a Java Application implementing the Graham scan.
The Graham Scan is an algorithm that finds the convex case for a given set of points.
For more information, check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan 
This was a project for my computer science studies at the university of constance.
Our task also included implenmenting a sorting algorithm and a datastructure that acts like a list.

# Usage
This implementation reads out list of coordinate. One pair per line, comma seperated.
The points needed for the convex case are printed to the console.

# What I learned
- Reading Text from Files
- Implementation of a sorting algorithm
- Implementation of a custom datastructure
