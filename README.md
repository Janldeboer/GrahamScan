# GrahamScan
This is a Java Application implementing the Graham scan.
The Graham Scan is an algorithm that finds the convex for a given set of points.
For more information, check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan 
This was a project for my computer science studies at the university of constance.

#Usage
This implementation reads out list of coordinates, given in the following pattern:
x,y
x,y
x,y
...
The points needed for the convex case are printed to the console.
